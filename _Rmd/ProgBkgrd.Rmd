## Programming Experience  

The majority of my programming experience was in the Fall 2021 term in `ISE 535 Intro to Python`. I also did a weeklong course, `Intro to R Programming` in 2018, and I took an introductory course in `SAS` during the summer of 2021. Unfortunately, at work I usually use Excel, and my programming gains atrophy quickly.
