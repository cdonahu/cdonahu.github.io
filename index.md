I am a student in NC State University's Master of Operations Research program, and I have created this blog for ST 558. I will maintain this blog during the course this summer.

## Blog Topics  
You can expect me to cover topics like:   
* What I am learning in ST 558  
* What I am learning in my other course, ST 590     
  - This course involves learning Python  
  - I will be working on individual and group projects
* What else I am up to this summer

  - Traveling over a weekend or two  
  - Figuring out current and future childcare, a constant work in progress
