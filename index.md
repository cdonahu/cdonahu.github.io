# Welcome to Claudia's Blog  

## About Me  
![My project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105885510/170123271-36bc4fe9-992c-4716-a9bf-300a7bc3e26f.jpg)  
I am a student in NC State University's Master of Operations Research program, and I have created this blog for ST 558. I will maintain this blog during the course this summer.     
I can be reached at cdonahu@ncsu.edu.  


## Blog Topics  
You can expect me to cover topics like:   
* What I am learning in ST 558  
* What I am learning in my other course, ST 590     
  - This course involves learning Python  
  - I will be working on individual and group projects
* What else I am up to this summer  
  - Hanging out locally with my family, mostly at the pool  
  - Traveling over a weekend or two  
  - Figuring out current and future childcare, a constant work in progress
